# Personal Loan Acceptance
This project uses a campaign dataset to build a **Logistic Regression** model that predicts whether an existing customer will accept a personal loan offer. It also identifies the key factors that influence this decision.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to help the bank convert existing customers into personal loan customers. A marketing campaign was conducted, and some customers responded positively by accepting the loan offer. 

Using this dataset, the goal is to:
- Build a predictive model for loan acceptance
- Identify important variables that influence a customerâ€™s decision
